# U-NET
The implement of U-NET with keras and TensorFlow. Algorithm for virus recognition has been executed.

# Note
I change a little bit of the epoch because my cell data isn't correct origin code. And I conducted Augmentation since my cell data(preprocessed) isn't enough.

[nn] is the indication of the sequence of progress of the algorithm.
[n1] = number1 

# Data
The data is not open data. So I didn't attach it.
